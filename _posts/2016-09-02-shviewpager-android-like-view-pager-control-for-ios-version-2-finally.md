It has been almost or, more than 2 years I had created [this controller](http://codewithshabib.com/2016/08/23/shtwodimensionalarray-a-simple-and-easy-to-use-two-dimensional-array-for-ios-applications/) called [SHViewPager](https://github.com/shabib87/SHViewPager). And to my utmost surprise a lot of people actually got benefited from it. Some of them requested for the support for screen orientation and iPad. I was a bit busy (actually lazy! sorry guys, truly!) to keep the request. Finally after a long wait, I was thinking, why am I not doing it?

So, I got my lazy ass moving and got it done. Now, the [SHViewPager](https://github.com/shabib87/SHViewPager) supports:

- All orientations
- iPad
- And it got even better, with:
  - Support for both `Swift` and `Objective-C`
  - Support for `Autolayout`
  - Simple installation via [Cocoapods](http://codewithshabib.com/2016/08/16/creating-your-own-cocoapod/)!

To use it in your app, you have to have `Xcode` 6+ and support `iOS` 8+. Here is a gif sample:

I am planning to keep supporting this library, so any feedback/suggestions are welcome. If you have found any bug, please report an issue for it. This library is under MIT license, so contribute, update, modify as per your need!

Cheers!
