# Citation Format

For writing assistance and review:

- keep citations lightweight and readable
- prefer inline references or a short source list when useful
- avoid cluttering narrative posts with academic-style citation noise unless the user wants that

For editorial workflow notes, keep a concise source record that future updates can revisit.
