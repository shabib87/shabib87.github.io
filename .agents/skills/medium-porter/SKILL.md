# Medium Porter

Use this skill when importing or cleaning up Medium-origin content.

## Workflow

1. Read `references/migration-checklist.md`.
2. Read `references/canonical-seo.md`.
3. Reuse the site's standard front matter and taxonomy conventions.
4. If the imported article still feels structurally weak or overly Medium-native, hand it to `technical-post-drafter` before final fact checking and publication.

## Output Expectations

- a site-native draft or post
- normalized metadata
- preserved voice with improved structure
- any follow-up fact-check or SEO notes

## Done Criteria

- the migrated article no longer feels like a raw Medium export
- metadata and structure are consistent with the rest of the site

## Rules

- Preserve the original voice and thesis.
- Improve structure, formatting, and metadata.
- Re-check time-sensitive technical claims.
- Avoid large rewrites unless the user explicitly asks for one.
