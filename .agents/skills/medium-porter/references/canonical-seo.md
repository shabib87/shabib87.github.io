# Canonical And SEO

When migrating Medium content:

- decide whether canonical references need to change
- preserve historically protected text unless the user explicitly asks for modernization
- exact source images are preferred, but relevant fallback images are acceptable when the original
  is blocked or unavailable
- treat image metadata and visible media presentation as separate checks
- avoid carrying over Medium-specific formatting or callout patterns that do not fit the site
