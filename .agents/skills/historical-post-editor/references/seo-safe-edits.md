# SEO Safe Edits

For preservation-mode updates:

- do not rewrite title or description for SEO without explicit approval
- do not change publish dates for SEO reasons
- improve OG, Twitter, JSON-LD, and canonical behavior without touching protected prose
- validate remote image behavior in both visible rendering and metadata output
- if the exact original image is unavailable, a relevant fallback image is acceptable when the user
  has allowed it
