# Context7 Lookup

- Resolve the exact product or library before querying docs.
- Ask behavior questions, not topic questions.
- Include the affected tool, feature, and operation in the query.
- Include version context when the user already supplied it.
- Prefer one precise query over a broad exploratory query when the behavior is already known.
- Use the returned docs to answer the implementation question directly.
