# Research Sequencing

1. Check the repo for the current local contract.
2. Check Context7 for official product or library behavior.
3. Check first-party docs when Context7 is not the right source.
4. Use general web search only when the first three steps do not answer the question.
5. Summarize the confirmed behavior and its implementation impact before editing code or docs.
