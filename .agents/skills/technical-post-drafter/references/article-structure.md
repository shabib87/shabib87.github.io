# Article Structure

Use these patterns when drafting or restructuring a post for this site.

## Default Shape

1. Hook: open on tension, failure, or a surprising observation in 1 to 3 short paragraphs.
2. Problem frame: explain why the reader should care now.
3. Main sections: use 2 to 4 H2s, each with one core idea, one concrete example, and one takeaway.
4. Synthesis: connect the sections back to broader engineering judgment.
5. Close: end with a practical takeaway, caution, or decision heuristic.

## Section Tests

- the first sentence tells the reader why the section exists
- the section ends with a takeaway or transition
- examples do real explanatory work instead of decoration
- subtle concepts get a contrast case, failure mode, or tradeoff

## Common Shapes

- debugging or incident post: symptom, false assumption, investigation, fix, transferable lesson
- architecture post: tension, constraints, options, chosen shape, implications
- AI or tools post: user problem, system limit, practical pattern, caveats, adoption advice
- leadership post: observed failure mode, mechanism, intervention, caution, repeatable heuristic

## Anti-Patterns

- tutorial openings that bury the real tension
- long context dumps before the thesis
- stacked abstractions with no story or example
- conclusions that only restate headings
