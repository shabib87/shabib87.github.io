# Drafting Rules

## Voice

- Write like a senior engineer explaining a pattern after seeing it fail in practice.
- Prefer strong nouns and verbs over hype.
- Keep confidence proportional to evidence.
- Use first person only when lived experience adds credibility.

## Hook And Flow

- Open on tension, consequence, or a mistaken assumption.
- Let each section answer a question created by the previous section.
- Trim throat-clearing and duplicated summaries.

## Examples

- Use one concrete example per major section when possible.
- Prefer system behavior, failure modes, or tradeoffs over toy examples.
- If a detail is illustrative but unverified, flag it for fact checking.

## Claim Marking

- Mark version-sensitive statements, product claims, and numbers for `fact-checker`.
- Do not invent citations or fake certainty.
- Separate observed opinion from source-backed fact.

## Finish Line

- Leave the reader with a heuristic, decision rule, or changed mental model.
- Identify the next workflow step: `fact-checker` or `jekyll-post-publisher`.
