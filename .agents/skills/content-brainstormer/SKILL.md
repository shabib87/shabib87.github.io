# Content Brainstormer

Use this skill when the user is choosing what to write next.

## Workflow

1. Read `references/positioning.md`.
2. Read `references/topic-selection.md`.
3. Use `references/editorial-calendar.md` when turning ideas into a backlog.

## Output Expectations

- topic ideas
- recommended angle
- hook options
- publishable outline directions
- backlog priority suggestions

## Done Criteria

- the user has a shortlist of ideas worth drafting
- the recommended topic supports authority-building
- the outline is strong enough to hand to `jekyll-post-publisher`

## Rules

- Bias toward authority-building, not generic traffic.
- Prefer topics grounded in real engineering judgment and lived experience.
- Suggest hooks, tension, and structure, not just titles.
