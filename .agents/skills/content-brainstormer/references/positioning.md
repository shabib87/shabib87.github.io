# Positioning

The site should compound authority in:

- mobile architecture
- debugging and failure analysis
- systems thinking
- AI engineering
- engineering leadership
- cross-platform strategy

Ideas that do not strengthen those themes should be deprioritized unless the user explicitly wants a personal or experimental post.
