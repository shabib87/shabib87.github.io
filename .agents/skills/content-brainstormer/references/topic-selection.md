# Topic Selection

Prefer topics that:

- reflect real-world judgment
- expose tradeoffs and design pressure
- connect technical depth to strategic thinking
- can produce a strong opinionated hook
- distinguish the author's point of view

Avoid ideas that are generic, too trend-chasing, or interchangeable with commodity tutorial content.
