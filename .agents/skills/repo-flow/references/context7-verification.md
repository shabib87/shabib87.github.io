# Context7 Verification

Use Context7 when the exact documented behavior of a tool matters for implementation details.

Typical cases:

- Codex customization behavior
- GitHub CLI flags or merge semantics
- GitHub Actions syntax
- Jekyll or Minimal Mistakes behavior

Do not use Context7 for repo-local facts that are already visible in files.
