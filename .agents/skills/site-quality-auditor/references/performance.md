# Performance Audit Notes

- Stay source-level unless the user explicitly asks for browser or lab tooling.
- Review global scripts and third-party assets first.
- Call out assets or scripts that load on every page.
- Flag obviously large local image assets when they are likely to affect page weight.
- Distinguish between confirmed source issues and performance hypotheses that need live measurement.
