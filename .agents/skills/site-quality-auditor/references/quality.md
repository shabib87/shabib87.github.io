# Quality Audit Notes

- Review `_config.yml`, shared head includes, archive pages, homepage or about page, and 404 behavior before drilling into individual files.
- Validate front matter presence, `title`, `description`, `layout`, and indexing-related fields.
- Surface manual preview requirements when site-facing files changed.
- Treat broken repo workflow guidance as a quality issue when it affects safe release flow.
