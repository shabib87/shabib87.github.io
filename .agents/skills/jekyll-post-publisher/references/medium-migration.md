# Medium Migration

When migrating a Medium post:

- preserve the original voice and thesis
- improve formatting, structure, metadata, and readability
- avoid turning the migration into a full rewrite unless asked
- re-check technical claims that may have drifted
- make the post feel native to this site rather than exported from another platform
