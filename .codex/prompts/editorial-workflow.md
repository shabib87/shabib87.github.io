# Editorial Workflow

Use this repository's editorial workflow.

- Route idea selection and outlines to `$content-brainstormer`.
- Route article drafting or restructuring to `$technical-post-drafter`.
- Route source verification to `$fact-checker`.
- Route metadata, validation, and publication work to `$jekyll-post-publisher`.
- Keep `_drafts/` private and local-only.
- If repo files are being changed, follow `$repo-flow` and require `make qa-local` before commit.
- Return the next concrete workflow step and the correct repo-local skill to use.
