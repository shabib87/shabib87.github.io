# Official Docs Workflow

Use the repository's official documentation verification workflow.

- Start with `$official-doc-verifier`.
- Check repo-local truth first.
- Use Context7 when the official docs are available there.
- Fall back to first-party docs only when Context7 is not the right source.
- Summarize the confirmed behavior and its implementation impact before editing code or docs.
