I like systems that tell clear stories. Over the years, I've learned that clear usually beats clever.

I've spent the last decade building and scaling mobile systems across iOS, React Native, and backend layers, from mobile architecture and CI/CD pipelines to cross-platform SDK integrations.

Most of my work lives at the intersection of teams: product, design, platform, and mobile. That's where the real design conversations happen; the ones that shape long-term systems, not just next week's release.

This site is where I occasionally write things down, patterns I've used (or avoided), how I think through decisions, and lessons I've picked up along the way.
