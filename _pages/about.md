I am a staff-level mobile engineer with over a decade of experience building systems across iOS, React Native, and backend services. Projects have ranged from mobile access and credential workflows to CI/CD pipelines and cross-platform architecture.

Often works at the intersection of product, platform, and mobile teams - figuring out integration paths, planning refactors, writing ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), and supporting SDK roll-outs across stacks.

Here I try to occasionally document what I've learned along the way - deep dives into mobile architecture, patterns Iâ€™ve found useful (or harmful), and occasional technical musings from the field.
