I'm a Staff-level Mobile Engineer with 12+ years of experience across iOS, React Native, and scalable backend systems.

I specialize in mobile architecture, SDK integrations, CI/CD tooling, and system design across cross-functional teams.

This site is a space for sharing lessons from the field â€” technical deep dives, patterns I've applied (or avoided), and thinking out loud.
