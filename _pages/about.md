I am a seasoned mobile engineer with over a decade of experience building systems across iOS, React Native, and backend services. My work spans from mobile system design, development, to CI/CD pipelines and cross-platform architecture.

I often work at the intersection of product, design, platform, and mobile teams - figuring out system design, planning refactors, writing ADRs (Architecture Decision Records), and supporting feature roll-outs across stacks.

Here I try to occasionally share what I've learned along the way - deep dives into mobile architecture, patterns Iâ€™ve found useful (or harmful), and occasional technical musings from the field.
